## Setup

1. `docker-compose build`

    blank （apps ディレクトリが空の場合）は以下を実行する

2. `docker-compose run app rails new . --force --no-deps --database=mysql --skip-bundle`
3. apps/config/database.yml を書き換える
```ruby
# MySQL. Versions 5.5.8 and up are supported.
#
# Install the MySQL driver
#   gem install mysql2
#
# Ensure the MySQL gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem 'mysql2'
#
# And be sure to use new-style password hashing:
#   https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/password-hashing.html
#
default: &default
  adapter: mysql2
  encoding: utf8mb4
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  username: root
  password:
  host: localhost

development:
  <<: *default
  database: apps_development
  host: db
  username: root
  password: password

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: apps_test
  host: db
  username: root
  password: password

# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: apps_production
  username: apps
  password: <%= ENV['APPS_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

4. `docker-compose up -d`
5. `docker-compose run rake db:create`
6. `docker-compose down`
